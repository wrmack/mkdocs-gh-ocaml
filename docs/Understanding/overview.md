# Understanding - Do I need this?

Probably not!

These topics are not needed to **know how to code** in OCaml but help with **understanding** OCaml. 

I found having at least a cursory knowledge of lambda calculus, type theory and category theory helped me understand the structure of functions and why OCaml has the types it has.

[The lambda calculus](lambda.md)

[Type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory).
